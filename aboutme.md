My name is Difan Song (宋迪凡). I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

- I am lucky to have been welcomed into the field of DOE.
- I believe in intuitive solutions to real-world problems.

The "Di" in my name stands for "Dihua," an old name for Urumqi, where I was born. "Fan" means ordinary, and that's who I am: an ordinary person from the city of Dihua.

- I love cooking because it offers much quicker feedback than research.
- I also love fountain pens and Chinese calligraphy.
- I owned three cats back at Urumqi. I suppose I do miss the company of a pet right now.
